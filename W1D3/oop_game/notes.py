#OOP FOUR PILLARS

#ENCAPSULATION
#Grouping code and data together into a single entity referred to as an Object

#INHERITANCE
#We can inherit from a class, allowing us to have all the same attributes and methods from that class

#POLYMORPHISM
#Literally - Many Forms -- a child class can have a different implementation for the same method as it got from the parent class

#ABSTRACTION
#This is the idea that we don't need to have all the information at our hands
